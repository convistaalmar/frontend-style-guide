# Less Workflow

1. Start from [scaffolding.less](../less/base/scaffolding.less) setting colors, typography and another global styles
2. Some global styles should be set on [variables.less](../less/base/variables.less) 
3. Once you are setup, you can start building your components
4. Basic components could be applied to text, tables, lists and forms and they can be created using one mixin per component
5. More complex components could be created using several mxins, modifiers y variants
6. In [samples.less](../less/samples.less) you will find examples for each of them
7. The [base.less](../less/base.less) stylesheet is intendeed for global styles and the first component to display in screen, while [screen.less](../less/screen.less) is for content components
