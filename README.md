CVAM's Frontend style guide
===========================

A set of development tools to build a style guide for your application's user interface. 

* Based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Include [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)
* And take advantage of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate some tasks

## Getting started

This guide is intended to give you a reference about the tools used through the development workflow and the code styling followed.

## Development Environment

If you haven't used Grunt before, you need to:
* Download an install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) in your computer. 
* Install the [Grunt's command line interface (CLI)](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli) globally:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

After installing, be sure that both are added to your `PATH` environment variable. Some modules also need [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) installed and added to `PATH`.

Now you to have two commands available to run through the command line from any directory:
* The `npm` command  to download and install [Node Package Modules](https://www.npmjs.org/)
* The `grunt` command to run tasks through your workflow.

To learn more about tasks config, please check the [Grunt's Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide. 

## Project setup

Clone the repository in your project's directory. Then, open a system console, navigate to the project root and run:

```
npm install
```

This will download and install all dependencies. When the installing is finished, setup the paths for your project's folders by copying the file `project-sample.json` as `project.json`. Then, you are ready to start using Grunt.

To see a list of available options and tasks type:
```
grunt -h
```

To make Grunt to watch for changes in your development files, type:
```
grunt watch
```

To generate the all assets in one step, type:
```
grunt update
```

To generate and lint the assets **before to commit**, type:
```
grunt commit
```

To generate the final assets for release, type:
```
grunt release
```

### Development Workflow

**Don't edit the files in these folders directly:** 
* `public/assets/html`
* `public/assets/css`
* `public/assets/js`
* `public/assets/svg`
* `public/assets/samples`

They are generated by the automated task from the source files in the `assets/` folder.

Follow these steps for proper coding workflow:

* To add a new page/screen, create a new `.html` file in `assets/pages/` folder; then continue editing those files for `HTML` changes
* You can use the snippets from the `.html` files in `assets/samples/` for a fatest component development, by copying them to your page files
* To modify common sections in pages (header, footer, etc.), edit the `.html` files in the `assets/sections/` folder (see [Grunt HTML Builder's wiki](https://github.com/spatools/grunt-html-build/wiki) to learn more about its tags)
* To add styling, edit the `.less` files in `assets/less/` (they are a modified version of [Bootstrap 3.3.7's Less library](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#less))
* You can use the styles from `.less` files in `assets/less/samples/` for a fatest component development, by moving the whole files or just cutting/copying the rules you need to your own component file
* Avoid using images as background for UI elements: use SVG when they are icons (see bellow), [CSS3 gradients](http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/) or [Less' `data-uri` function](http://lesscss.org/functions/#misc-functions-data-uri) (dropping the file in `assets/images/`)
* To use images in content (using `<img>` tags) or as decorative background, drop them directly in ´public/assets/img/´
* To add UI icons, drop a single file for each one in `assets/icons/` and use them with `SVG`'s `<use>` tag ([read this article to learn more](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/))
* To add custom scripts, create a single file for each interaction or component in `assets/scripts/main/`
* To add external plugins, drop a single file in `assets/scripts/plugins/` (remember to add all plugin metadata like version, repository uri, etc. at the top of it)

### Vendor libraries

* Bootstrap and HTML5Boilerplate are included for reference: you can copy and paste files or code snippets from them to your apropiate sources
* jQuery and Modernizr can be automatically updated by switching the submodule's working copy to the latest release's tag
